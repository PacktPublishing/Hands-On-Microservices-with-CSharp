## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code files are there in MicroServiceEcoSystem folder except Chapter02.

* While doing the code testing on this title please refer the software hardware list from Packt website
* The complete code bundle, including Chapter02 log file can be downloaded from the Packt website

The code will look like the following:
```
public class DeploymentStartMessage
{
public DateTime Date { get; set; }
}
public class DeploymentStopMessage
{
public DateTime Date { get; set; }
} 
```

**Following is what you need for this book:**

C# developers, software architects, and professionals who want to master the art of designing the microservice architecture that 
is scalable based on environment. Developers should have a basic understanding of.NET application development using C# and Visual Studio

With the following software and hardware list you can run all code files present in the book (Chapter 1-14).
