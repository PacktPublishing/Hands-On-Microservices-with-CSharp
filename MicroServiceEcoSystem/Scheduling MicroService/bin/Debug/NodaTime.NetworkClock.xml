            <summary>
            Gets or sets the NTP server to use.  Defaults to "pool.ntp.org"

        <member name="P:NodaTime.NetworkClock.CacheTimeout">
            <summary>
            Gets or sets the timeout for the cache, which prevents the NTP server from being called too often.
            Within the cache period, the time is resolved by taking the value last received, and adding the time elapsed since that call.
            Defaults to 15 minutes.
